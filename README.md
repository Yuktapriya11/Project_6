This project consists of two core data science tasks: Time Series Analysis for forecasting sales and Logistic Regression for predicting heart disease. In the Time Series task, we analyze historical sales data using visualization techniques like line plots and moving averages to identify trends and seasonality. We then apply the ARIMA model to generate a 30-day forecast of future sales, evaluating its accuracy using RMSE and MAPE metrics. In the second task, we use a dataset of patient health metrics to build a Logistic Regression model that classifies whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The model's performance is assessed using a confusion matrix and classification metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score. Sample datasets (sales_data.csv and heart_disease.csv) have been created and used to demonstrate both tasks. This project showcases essential skills in data preprocessing, model training, forecasting, and evaluation, using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels.
